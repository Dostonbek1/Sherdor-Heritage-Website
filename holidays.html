            <div class="item-text">
                <p>All men of Uzbekistan are celebrated on this day. Because initially every man is the defender of his honor, home and Motherland… But particularly warm words sound at this holiday about military men, for whom the 14th of January (the day, when Armed Forces of Uzbekistan were established) is the professional holiday. The Day of defenders of Motherland is the great state holiday and it is observed in broad and spectacular way. This day the ranks of military men in full dress are lined up on the main square of the country in order to accept congratulations and awards from the leader of the country.</p>

                <p>The representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, National Security Service and other institutions participate in this ceremony. The moment, when the marching of all force divisions begins along the square to the sound of military orchestra, is particularly colorful. Participants of the parade also lay the wreaths to the monument of Independence.</p>

            <h3 class="item-heading">Navruz</h3>
            <div class="item-text">
                <p>On this very day, 21 March, when daytime and night are equal, a new solar cycle begins as well as a new astronomical year; thus, consequently the law of renewal enters its strength. That is why Navruz for Turkic and Iranian people is the same as the New Year for western part of the world. Later, during the Akhemenids (6-4th centuries B.C.), Navruz received an official status shifting from a farming ritual to a Zoroastrian holiday and was tied to a cult of Sun and Zaratustra. Today Navruz holiday is a national event and one of the main Uzbek traditions, and it is full of ancient unique rituals and beautiful customs like in ancient times.</p>

                <p>The main mystery happens on the night of March 21. It is time for preparation of the main ceremonial meal from germinated wheat: sumalak. The whole mahalla, mostly women, gather near the huge pot: sit in a circle, sing songs, have fun, each of them waits for their turn to stir the sumalak. In the morning still warm sumalak is handed out to neighbors, relatives and friends. Tasting the sumalak it is necessary to make a wish, which, the locals say, will come true.</p>
